# Task:
Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85

# Deduction:
This can be done by adding a new entry to the `/etc/hosts`.
To do this, we need to define the IP and the domain in the entry.
The first column contains the IP address and the second column contains the url.

$ sudo vim /etc/hosts

add the following:
46.19.122.85	 intra.42.fr

Save & quit

Can test with
$ traceroute intra.42.fr
