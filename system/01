# System 01

# Task:
In what file can you find the installed version of your Debian?

# Deduction:
The /etc/debian_version contains the debian version
$ cat /etc/debian_version

However, the /etc/os-release file conatins system information
$ cat /etc/os-release

Information can also be found in /etc/issue
$ cat /etc/issue
