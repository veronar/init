# Task:
Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the DNS server youâ€™re using

# Command:
#!/bin/sh
cat /etc/resolv.conf

# Deduction:
DNS is an acronym for Domain Name System. DNS is key to many network services run on the Internet or LAN (Local Area Network)
Almost all traffic on the Internets depends upon the DNS servers. Most ISP (Internet Service Provider) have their caching DNS server to reduce network load.
Under Linux, FreeBSD and all UNIX-like operating systems you have a file called /etc/resolv.conf. It is often known as the resolver configuration file.
